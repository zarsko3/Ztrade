# üöÄ Supabase RLS Performance Optimization Guide

## üéâ Security Issues Resolved!

Great news! The critical security vulnerabilities have been fixed. Now let's optimize the RLS policies for better performance.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Performance Warnings to Address

The Supabase linter is now flagging two performance issues:

### 1. **auth_rls_initplan** - Function Re-evaluation Issue
**Problem:** `auth.uid()` is being called for every row, killing index scans
**Impact:** Slow queries, especially on large tables

### 2. **multiple_permissive_policies** - Policy Consolidation Issue  
**Problem:** Multiple permissive policies for same role+action create OR-chains
**Impact:** Repeated condition checks per row

## üîß Performance Fixes Applied

### Fix 1: Optimize auth.uid() Calls

**Before (Slow):**
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Users can read their own trades"
  ON public.trades
  FOR SELECT
  USING (user_id = auth.uid());
```

**After (Fast):**
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Users can read their own trades"
  ON public.trades
  FOR SELECT
  USING (user_id = (SELECT auth.uid()));
```

**Why it works:**
- `(SELECT auth.uid())` is a scalar subquery
- PostgreSQL evaluates it once per query, not per row
- Enables index scans and much better performance

### Fix 2: Consolidate Multiple Policies

**Before (Multiple policies):**
```sql
-- Multiple policies for same role/action
CREATE POLICY "Policy 1" ON trades FOR SELECT TO authenticated USING (condition1);
CREATE POLICY "Policy 2" ON trades FOR SELECT TO authenticated USING (condition2);
CREATE POLICY "Policy 3" ON trades FOR SELECT TO authenticated USING (condition3);
```

**After (Single consolidated policy):**
```sql
-- One policy with OR conditions
CREATE POLICY "Consolidated policy" ON trades 
  FOR SELECT TO authenticated 
  USING (condition1 OR condition2 OR condition3);
```

## üìÅ Files Created

### `scripts/optimize-rls-performance.sql`
- **Complete performance optimization script**
- Fixes both `auth_rls_initplan` and `multiple_permissive_policies`
- Includes verification queries
- Safe execution with existence checks

## üöÄ How to Apply Performance Fixes

### Step 1: Run the Optimization Script

1. **Open Supabase Dashboard**
   - Go to [https://supabase.com/dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
   - Select your project: `khfzxzkpdxxsxhbmntel`

2. **Navigate to SQL Editor**
   - Click "SQL Editor" in the left sidebar
   - Click "New query"

3. **Run the optimization script**
   - Copy the entire content of `scripts/optimize-rls-performance.sql`
   - Paste into Supabase SQL Editor
   - Click "Run"

### Step 2: Verify the Optimizations

The script includes verification queries that will show:
- ‚úÖ Current permissive policies
- ‚úÖ RLS status on all tables
- ‚úÖ Policy counts per table
- ‚úÖ Detailed policy information

### Step 3: Test Performance

After running the script, test with some queries:

```sql
-- Test trades table performance
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM trades WHERE user_id = 'some-user-id';

-- Test performance table
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM performance WHERE user_id = 'some-user-id';
```

**Expected improvements:**
- ‚úÖ Index scans instead of sequential scans
- ‚úÖ Faster query execution times
- ‚úÖ Reduced CPU usage

## üìä Performance Impact

### Before Optimization
- ‚ùå `auth.uid()` called for every row
- ‚ùå Multiple policy evaluations per row
- ‚ùå Sequential scans on large tables
- ‚ùå Slow query performance

### After Optimization
- ‚úÖ `auth.uid()` called once per query
- ‚úÖ Single policy evaluation per row
- ‚úÖ Index scans enabled
- ‚úÖ Fast query performance

## üîç Verification Commands

### Check Current Permissive Policies
```sql
SELECT 
  table_schema, 
  table_name, 
  policy_name, 
  roles, 
  cmd,
  permissive
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE permissive = true 
  AND table_schema = 'public'
ORDER BY table_name, roles, cmd;
```

### Check Policy Performance
```sql
-- Look for scalar subqueries in policies
SELECT 
  schemaname,
  tablename,
  policyname,
  qual,
  with_check
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
  AND (qual LIKE '%SELECT auth.uid()%' OR with_check LIKE '%SELECT auth.uid()%')
ORDER BY tablename, policyname;
```

## üö® Important Notes

### Before Running
1. **Backup your current policies** (the script will drop and recreate them)
2. **Test in development** first if possible
3. **Have your service role key ready** for verification

### After Running
1. **Test all application features** to ensure they still work
2. **Monitor query performance** for improvements
3. **Run the Supabase linter** to confirm warnings are gone

### If Something Goes Wrong
1. **Don't panic** - the original policies can be restored
2. **Check the error messages** in Supabase logs
3. **Verify table names** match exactly
4. **Ensure RLS is still enabled** on all tables

## üìà Expected Results

After running the optimization:

### Supabase Linter
- ‚úÖ No more `auth_rls_initplan` warnings
- ‚úÖ No more `multiple_permissive_policies` warnings
- ‚úÖ All security checks still pass

### Performance
- ‚úÖ Faster query execution
- ‚úÖ Better index utilization
- ‚úÖ Reduced database load
- ‚úÖ Improved application responsiveness

### Application
- ‚úÖ All features continue to work
- ‚úÖ User data isolation maintained
- ‚úÖ Service role access preserved
- ‚úÖ No breaking changes

## üîÑ Rollback Plan

If you need to rollback to the previous policies:

```sql
-- Re-run the original fix script
-- scripts/fix-supabase-rls-simple.sql
```

This will restore the original policies (without performance optimizations but with security fixes).

## üìû Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the Supabase logs in the dashboard
2. Verify the optimization script ran successfully
3. Test with the verification queries
4. Compare query performance before/after
